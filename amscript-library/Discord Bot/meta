description: Connects a Discord channel to the in-game chat


Usage:

1. Read this guide to set up a Discord application:
    https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

2. Copy the API key (client secret) to the 'api_key' below as a string

3. Add the application to your Discord server, and copy the channel ID of the channel for the shared chat to 'chat_channel' below

4. This bot will automatically start and stop with your server. Additionally, it requires the "read messages" intent to function properly

5. To extend the functionality of your bot, put normal discord.py functionality inside of the '@server.on_start()' event
