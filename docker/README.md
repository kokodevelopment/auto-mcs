# Docker Stuff
This is a placeholder for now

- [ ] Setup password for TTYD
- [ ] Fix tar issues on Alpine (for example, installing Java doesn't work)
- [ ] Add persistent directory for applicationFolder
- [ ] Remove Kivy dependencies from Alpine build with a custom .spec and reqs
- [ ] Eventually turn Alpine Build into Docker image, and don't upload Alpine as an artifact
